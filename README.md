## API Design

Strapi is a headless CMS that comes with an admin panel where content types can be specified. This admin panel enables the product owner of this project to manage content on his website without having coding experience. These content types generates basic controllers and services, providing endpoints for each content type to be fetched from.

The Strapi database is built with SQLite and Javascript.
